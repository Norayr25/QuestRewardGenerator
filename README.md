# Quest Reward Generator

## Overview

The quest reward generator is a Java application designed to generate a sequence of quest rewards based on a predefined pattern. The application uses Lagrange interpolation to create sequences for any given number of quests, ensuring that the distribution of rewards closely follows the original pattern.

## Features

Generates a sequence of quest rewards (b for bronze chest and s for silver chest) based on a predefined pattern.

Uses Lagrange interpolation to ensure smooth transitions and accurate representation of the predefined pattern for any number of quests.

## Predefined Pattern

The predefined pattern for 100 quests is:
bbbbbbbbbsbbbbbbbbsbbbsbbbsbbbbsbsbbsbsbbsbbsbsbsbsbssbsbsbsbsbsssbsssbssbssbsssssbssssssbssssssssss


## Example of usage
